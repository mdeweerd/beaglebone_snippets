Beaglebone Black power management IC

TI TPS65217  http://www.ti.com/product/tps65217C

The chip on board the BBB has an I2C interface that tells us stuff about how it is being powered and if it is charging a battery.

[Using a battery]
Note that when hooking up a LiPo battery (such as the thin ones from Sparkfun)  you must make all the connections to enable charging:

TP5/BAT => Battery+
TP6/SENSE=> BAT pin on PCB
TP7/TS => 10K NTC thermistor to ground. Or perhaps a 10K resistor to fool it.
TP8/GND => Battery-

[Safe shutdown]
You can treat the battery like a UPS - when we detect we are on battery-only for too long, issue a safe linux shutdown command to prevent file system corruption.
See safe_shutdown.py for an example that can be used as a Linux daemon to run on startup.

[Reading the PMIC]
PMIC  is on I2C-0 address 0x24
Easy to get started: use i2cget from the shell to query specific registers.
The specific register addresses and their meanings are in the datasheet.

Example: get the STATUS (0xA) register which tells us which power inputs (USB, AC) are active.
If neither are true then we must be on battery!

i2cget -y -f 0 0x24 0xA

powerstatus.py uses this easy shell cmd to query a couple useful regs and print the results

Sample output of powerstatus.py for an AC powered beagle with no battery:
